A Neural Network implementation in Java:

My implementation of a neural network in java from scratch, except for the Matrix operations because I had a hard enough time with the derivatives...

With help from [this medium article](https://medium.com/@waadlingaadil/learn-to-build-a-neural-network-from-scratch-yes-really-cac4ca457efc), but all code was written by me, no AI help involved in writing the code. 

Linear Algebra package from https://github.com/danhales/linearalgebra

Future improvements: 

* add different choices for loss and activation functions
* load data from a csv file, instead of hardcoded
* Move backpropagation operations onto the GPU
* Implement more advanced network types...
